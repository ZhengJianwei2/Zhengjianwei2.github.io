<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree (supervised by Prof. [Xi-Le Zhao](https://zhaoxile.github.io/)) with the School of Mathematical Sciences, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), Chengdu, China.

My research interest includes image processing, tensor learning, and fast algorithm.
